To create a backdoor, we must create two programs
1. Server (Our Linux machine)
2. Payload (On target machine)

From the server we'll be sending instructions to the payload (which is on the target machine)
From the payload we want to send back our output to the server
This is the communication between server and the payload looks like

You must know little bit about that we are using in this project
1.Reverse TCP
2.Ports
3.python sockets
4.Compiling python to exe (For our windows target)
